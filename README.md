# Gas-Fire-Detector
Project Name: Gas & Fire Detector

Tools: Proteus

Languages: C++

Description:In this project, a gas sensor module is used to detect gases and a flame sensor
module to detect explosions and fires by measuring the levels of radiation in the
atmosphere. Either gas leakage or explosions occurs , the appropriate sensor is
activated and that gives a high pulse and when the Arduino gets a high pulse
from the sensor, it sends a signal to the LCD. Then the LCD would show the
“Gas Detected!" or "Fire Detected!" message along with red light showing in
the LED and activates the buzzer which beeps again and again until the gas
detector doesn’t sense any gas or flame in the environment. If both are detected,
it will give emergency message along with more louder alarm and beeping red
light signal. Else, the gas sensor and flame sensor both give low pulse to the
Arduino, then LCD would then show the “Safe Now!” message and then green
light will be lit up in the LED.
